# Voice Agents System

An integrated voice agent system for both inbound support and outbound sales calls, powered by ElevenLabs conversational AI.

## Technology Stack

- **Inbound Agent**: OpenPhone for handling incoming support calls
- **Outbound Agent**: Twilio for making outbound sales calls
- **Deployment**: Render for cloud hosting
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n CLI for building and maintaining workflows
- **Voice/AI**: ElevenLabs for text-to-speech and conversational AI
- **Knowledge Base**: Vector database (Pinecone) for storing and retrieving information
- **Audio Processing**: ffmpeg for format conversion between ElevenLabs and Twilio

## System Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Core Backend Service**: Node.js API server handling both inbound and outbound calls
2. **n8n Workflows**: For orchestrating interactions and scheduling outbound calls
3. **Knowledge Base**: Vector database with embeddings for agent responses
4. **ElevenLabs Integration**: For voice synthesis and conversational AI
5. **Redis**: For inter-process communication and session management

## Features

- **Inbound Support Agent**:
  - Handles incoming calls via OpenPhone
  - Engages customers with AI-powered conversation
  - Accesses knowledge base to provide accurate information

- **Outbound Sales Agent**:
  - Initiates calls to leads via Twilio
  - Conducts sales conversations using ElevenLabs AI
  - Follows scripts from the knowledge base with dynamic responses
  - Automatically converts audio formats for seamless communication

- **Knowledge Management**:
  - Vector database for semantic search
  - Automated updates via n8n workflows
  - Supports multiple data formats (JSON, CSV, TXT)

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Redis server (for session management and message passing)
- Accounts with OpenPhone, Twilio, ElevenLabs, and Pinecone
- n8n CLI (for workflow development)
- Render account (for deployment)
- ffmpeg (for audio format conversion)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mostaysaucin/buzallysalesandsupport.git
   cd buzallysalesandsupport
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

4. Start the server and worker processes:
   ```bash
   # Start the main server
   node server.js
   
   # In a separate terminal, start the worker process
   node queueWorker.js
   ```

5. For testing an outbound call:
   ```bash
   # Run this in a separate terminal - DO NOT run the worker with --test flag
   node ../queueWorker.js --test +DESTINATION_NUMBER +YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER
   ```

### n8n Workflow Setup

1. Install n8n CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g n8n
   ```

2. Start n8n server:
   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

3. Import the workflow files from the `n8n-workflows` directory

### Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Render using the included `render.yaml` file:

1. Push the code to a Git repository
2. Link the repository to Render
3. Use the Blueprint to deploy both the API and n8n services

## API Endpoints

### Inbound Agent

- `POST /api/inbound/call` - Handle incoming call webhook
- `POST /api/inbound/voice` - Process voice input from call
- `POST /api/inbound/hangup` - Handle call termination

### Outbound Agent

- `POST /api/outbound/call` - Initiate outbound call
- `GET /api/outbound/twiml/:sessionId` - Generate TwiML for call
- `POST /api/outbound/status/:sessionId` - Process call status updates
- `POST /api/outbound/stream/:sessionId` - WebSocket endpoint for Twilio Media Streams

### Knowledge Base

- `POST /api/knowledge` - Add item to knowledge base
- `GET /api/knowledge/query` - Query knowledge base
- `DELETE /api/knowledge/:id` - Delete item from knowledge base
- `POST /api/knowledge/batch` - Batch import to knowledge base

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Format Compatibility

This system includes a solution to address the audio format incompatibility between ElevenLabs and Twilio:
- ElevenLabs always returns MP3 audio regardless of requested format
- Twilio requires Î¼-law 8kHz audio for bidirectional streams
- The system automatically converts audio formats using ffmpeg

### Process Management

- The application requires two separate processes to run properly:
  1. `server.js` - Handles HTTP and WebSocket connections
  2. `queueWorker.js` - Processes call queue and maintains ElevenLabs sessions
- Never run the worker with the `--test` flag for production use as it will terminate after initiating a call
- For testing, use a separate test harness that initiates calls while the main processes handle the actual call flow
